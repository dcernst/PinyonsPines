## 2023 Results

<!-- Posted within a few days after Grand Depart. -->

The 2023 Grand Depart took place at 6am on Thursday, May 18.

### Short Course

Mother nature came to play this year.  Day two of the race dumped a LOT of rain on the AZT along a section that is notorious for "death mud". In order to protect both the trail and the integrity of bikepacking races like Pinyons and Pines, we made the call mid-race to avoid miles 219-263 and 288-295, which utilize the AZT.  This decision was based on the radar, word of mouth about conditions on the course, and disucssions with folks familar with the area and bikepacking races. If even one person outside of the event complained that we destroyed the AZT, it could put this event and others like it at risk.  Currently, we fly under the radar and abide by vague rules concerning "events" under 75 people.  We opted to play it safe and not risk the potential for damage. This decision is likely unpopular for some folks, but we stand by it.  We were not terribly concerned about riders mucking around in the mud on dirt roads. Riding around in the rain and mud isn't very enjoyable, but we didn't have any apprehension about most of the rest of the course.

Once the decision to modify the route was made, we did our best to notify all of the short course riders that were spread out over a hundred miles of the course.  We sent a text message to every rider on the short course, an email to all the riders, and posted on social media.  It took a while, but eventually the word got out.  Thankfully it was pretty easy to bypass miles 219-263 by utilizing Lake Mary Road. This potential detour was relayed to riders several days in advance when the weather forecast looked pretty grim. Unfortunately, there wasn't an easy to implement detour to bypass miles 288-295.

Riders were instructed to do one of the following:
   1. Hunker down for a while and hope things dry out. 
   2. If they were are already on the AZT, get to Lake Mary Road Pavement at their earliest convenience and perhaps just stay on pavement the rest of the way by to Flagstaff depending on how conditions evolved.
   3. For riders that were currently in the Mogollon Rim area (roughly miles 175-219), they could either ride Hwy 87 to Lake Mary Road or attempt to cut across on FS 211 after crossing Hwy 87.
   4. For riders that had not made it to the Mogollon Rimm yet, they could decide what they thought was best and try to make an enjoyable ride out of it.

Unfortunately, the timing of these events had a significant impact on the outcome of the race.  The three leaders (Jacob Miller, Stephen Searle, and Jesse Reeves) were already in the midst of riding the AZT.  The gaps between these riders were pretty significant and we are confident that if the shit hadn't hit the fan, Jacob Miller, Stephen Searle, and Jesse Reeves would have finished first, second, and third respectively.  The hope was to get all three to follow the same route back to town, but alas that isn't how things transpired.  Jacob opted to rejoin the route at mile 263.5 and followed Wiemer Springs Road all the way back to Lake Mary Road.  In hindsight, I (Dana) wish I would have initially encouraged all three riders to do this. I was in the midst of responding to numerous messages, attempting to give beta to folks out in the storm, and by the time I realized what route Jacob was taking, it didn't leave much time to get the word out to Stephen and Jesse.  I attempted to contact them, but they were likely out of cell range or just had their heads down and were trying to make it back to town. In the end, Stephen made it to the finish first, but Jacob followed more of the course and rode significantly more miles with quite a bit more climbing. Jesse followed the same route as Stephen.

Meanwhile the next group of riders, which contained the top four women, were about to enter the section of the AZT we were concerned about.  At this time, it is likely that a few of them had not gotten the word on the upcoming conditions. I (Dana) exchanged several text messages with Sam McLaughlin. He indicated that conditions didn't look too bad at the begining of the AZT section. I figued this would be the case based on the soil in the area. I told him that I trusted his judgement and to do what he thought was best.  He and the lead pink dots (Lilly Hacker, Claire Burke, Leigh Bowe, and Liz Sampey) all opted to give it a go.  Eventually, all of them were confronted with the notorious Northern Arizona death mud and turned around.  The top five pink dots opted to pull the plug at that point and got a ride back to Flagstaff. 

One regret I have is not more clearly communicating to the rest of the folks out on course that there were encouraged to give the lollipop on the Mogollon Rim a shot.  I knew that this section of the course had not received as much rain and I had no concerns about folks riding on potentially muddy roads.  

By the end of day two, the short course turned into the "choose your own adventure edition" of Pinyons and Pines.  As time went on, thing dried out and conditions improved. This meant that riders near the back of the pack were able to ride more and more of the intended course. Instead of listing finish times for folks like we have in the past, we will attempt to summarize who rode what version of a loop.
