## Course Description

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Important!</strong> Due to logging operations in Flagstaff, the originally proposed route needed to be modified in a few spots.  The route posted on RideWithGPS is the final version of the route, but the course description has not yet been updated.  I'll update the verbal description by May 3.  The final GPX file has been emailed to registered participants.
</div>

The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops. The total elevation gain for the route is about 21,000 feet, split evenly between the two loops. The start and finish is at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com).

The first loop (125 miles) begins with a neutral rollout as the route heads south and navigates through the campus of Northern Arizona University. After about 1.5 miles, the route hangs a right on a portion of the Flagstaff Urban Trail (FUTS). The race is on after the group crosses Mt. Dell Road, roughly mile 3.3. Riders will turn right at mile 4.5 and follow singletrack for roughly 8.5 miles before reaching Woody Mountain Road. The route then heads south following mostly dirt roads and eventually descends [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Riders get to sample some of Sedona's sweet singletrack as they navigate towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. Riders should be sure to refuel and stock up on food and water before ascending Schnebly Hill Road. After crossing under Interstate 17, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) near [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north via mostly singletrack back to Flagstaff to finish the first loop.

The second loop (155 miles) winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". After refueling in Flagstaff, the second loop begins by heading north to rejoin the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. After descending singletrack through an aspen grove, the course merges with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html) and follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet), and eventually descends on double track to [Babbit Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). As the route turns south, riders will cross over a lava flow and pedal by [SP Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_P_Crater), the first of several cinder cone volcanoes. The route then turns east around [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet) and onto loose cinder trails that link into the back entrance of [Sunset Crater National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Crater). Riders then follow pavement through the National Monument along recent lava flows before climbing a steep dirt road into Lockett Meadow (see image above) and the "inner basin" of the San Francisco Peaks. From here, riders will climb to Waterline Road via beautiful but technical singletrack to the highest part of the route. While descending Waterline Road, riders will pass through remnants of the [Schultz Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schultz_Fire) while enjoying huge views along the west side of the Peaks. At the bottom of Waterline Road, the route picks up the equestrian bypass of the AZT, contours around the east side of [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet), and eventually passes along the rim of Walnut Canyon. The final few miles of the second loop are the same as the first loop. The route finishes at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution.

The final version of the GPX track will be posted on this page a few weeks before the start of the race.

## Resupply Notes

Below are some notes concerning resupply options for food and water.

- **Mile 67.3:** Shortly after merging onto Highway 89A, you'll have a few options for stocking up on food and water before leaving Sedona. There is a 76 gas station on the right side of Highway 89A at the second round about that has a modest supply of snacks. After turning south on Route 179, Arroyo Roble Marketplace is on the right side of the road. There is a Circle K on Route 179 about a quarter of a mile part the turn onto Schnebly Hill Road. If you want to grab a meal, there is a Burger King on the right side of 89A just before the second round about and Oregano's is a short distance south on Route 179. Both of these are on route. In addition, Starbucks, Chipotle, and Wildflower Bread Company are in a shopping plaza on a hill on 89A a bit north of the intersection with Route 179. There are also a few bike shops in Sedona.  [Over the Edge](https://otesports.com/locations/sedona/) and the [Fat Tire Bike Shop](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Fat-Tire-Bike-Shop/188731981168703) are the closest shops to the route.
- **Mile 79.6:** There is a water spigot at the ADOT yard just before crossing under Interstate 17. There is no guarantee that we'll have access to this spigot or that the spigot will be turned on, so do not assume that you can get water here.
- **Mile 93:** In the event of an emergency, you can detour a few miles off route to Mormon Lake Lodge.
- **Mile 124.5:** Just north of the turn on E. Franklin Ave, there is a shopping plaza with REI, Wildflower Bread Company, and Whole Foods.
- **Mile 125.2:** As you pass through downtown Flagstaff, there are several restaurants. Depending on the time of day, consider stopping at Tourist Home Cafe (on route), Macy's Coffee House (2 blocks off route), Diablo Burger (1 block off route).
- **Mile 126:** There is a Basha's grocery store at the top of N. Humphreys Stree, just a few blocks off route to the west.
- **Mile 173:** There is a fairly consistent stock tank on the left side of the road. You'll definitely need to filter/treat the water.
- **Mile 189.6:** Where the AZT merges in from the right, there is a public cache box hidden in the bushes. Do not take any water (or food) that is designated for an individual. The race organizer (Dana Ernst) will stock this cache before and after the race.
- **Mile 230.3:** There is a drinking fountain and a vending machine at the Sunset Crater National Monument Visitor's Center, which is on the left side of the road.
- **Mile 237:** Just as you enter Lockett Meadow, there is a small pond on the right. You'll need to filter/treat the water.
- **Mile 254.5:** Shortly after passing through a tunnel under Route 89, you can access the Conoco Travel Center (open 24 hours) by turning right on double track. This is a very short distance off route.
