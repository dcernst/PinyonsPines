Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops. The first loop is 125 miles and passes through [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet) prior to following the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) back to Flagstaff.  The second loop is 155 miles and circumnavigates several extinct volcanoes, including the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona. The second loop overlaps substantially with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html). The total elevation gain for the route is about 21,000 feet. Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Pinyons and Pines is an ideal first bikepacking race, but the stunning scenery should make it appealing to experts and beginners alike.

The race organizer is [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com). Please [contact him](mailto:ernst.tribe@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

<strong>Important!</strong> This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time in comparison to others. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

The event will utilize [Trackleaders](http://trackleaders.com), providing a live map, elevation profile and other stats that can be used to follow along. Carrying a personal tracker (e.g., [SPOT](https://www.findmespot.com/en/), [Garmin InReach](https://explore.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/)) and being tracked by trackleaders is not mandatory but encouraged. Owners of personal trackers can expect to pay $15 to add their own device to Trackleaders. SPOT rentals (approximately $60 for a SPOT Gen3 with 5min tracking service and SOS) will also be available. Tracking signup link will be available about a month before race start.
