Pinyons and Pines is a 280-mile underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  Riders have the option of racing as an individual or as part of a 2-person team. Finish times will be listed as two different categories. The race organizer is [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com). Please [contact him](mailto:ernst.tribe@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

The **2019** edition of Pinyons and Pines will start on **Saturday, May 18** at 6AM at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com).

**Important!** This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time in comparison to others. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

## Rules ##

The rules for this event follow the same principles as similar bikepacking races.  The following guidelines are a remix of the rules for the [Colorado Trail Race](http://www.climbingdreams.net/ctr/), [Arizona Trail Race](http://topofusion.com/azt/race.php), and [Bones to Blue Bikepacking Race](http://bonestoblue.com). We rely on the honor system, so be honorable and have a great ride.

- Be overly courteous to all trail users. Just because you are racing does not mean you have right of way! Yield to hikers, equestrians, and uphill bikers.
- Complete the entire route, under your own power.
- Follow the GPX track as best you can. Small deviations and side trips are fine. Intentionally skipping part of the route is a not okay.
- If you must deviate substantially from the route for any reason (e.g., medical, mechanical) but wish to continue in the race, then you must return to the point of the course where you deviated.
- If you are racing as an individual, you should carry your own gear, food, water, etc.
- If you are racing as part of a 2-person team, you and your partner may share resources.
- You may ride with other people, but drafting is not allowed.
- Unplanned support from other racers is allowed.
- Support crews and pacers are not allowed.
- Visitation by spectators (friends, family) is okay provided the visit is short and no support is provided.
- Individual caches (food, water, etc) are not allowed.
- Gas stations, restaurants, hotels, campgrounds, and any other commercial services along the route are fair game as long as they are not pre-arranged.
- Practice “leave no trace”. In particular, do not litter!
- Follow all traffic laws. You must use lights when riding at night on any public roads.
- Unless you can actually see another rider coming behind you, always close a gate you open.
- At roughly mile 190, you will pass by a public water cache for the Arizona Trail. Do not take any water (or food) that is designated for an individual. The race organizer (Dana Ernst) will stock this cache before and after the race.

## Course Overview ##

The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops.

The first loop (125 miles) begins by traveling south on mostly dirt roads and eventually descends [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Riders get to sample some of Sedona's sweet singletrack as they navigate towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. After ascending Schnebly Hill Road, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) near [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north back to Flagstaff to finish the first loop.

The second loop (155 miles) winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". After refueling in Flagstaff, the second loop begins by heading north to rejoin the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. After descending singletrack through an aspen grove, the course follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet), and eventually descends on double track to [Babbit Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). As the route turns south, riders will cross over a lava flow and pass by [SP Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_P_Crater), the first of several cinder cone volcanoes. The route then turns east around [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet) and onto loose cinder trails that link into the back entrance of [Sunset Crater National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Crater). Riders then follow pavement through the National Monument along recent lava flows before climbing a steep dirt road into Lockett Meadow (see image above) and the "inner basin" of the San Francisco Peaks. From here, riders will climb to Waterline Road via beautiful but technical singletrack to the highest part of the route. While descending Waterline Road, riders will pass through remnants of the [Schultz Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schultz_Fire) while enjoying huge views along the west side of the Peaks. At the bottom of Waterline Road, the route picks up the equestrian bypass of the AZT, contours around the east side of [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet), and eventually passes along the rim of Walnut Canyon. The final few miles of the second loop are the same as the first loop. The route finishes at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution.

<!-- Scraps

The second loop also circumnavigates [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet), and [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet).
