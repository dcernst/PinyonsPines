Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops.

The first loop (125 miles) begins by traveling south on mostly dirt roads and eventually descends [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Riders get to sample some of Sedona's sweet singletrack as they navigate towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. After ascending Schnebly Hill Road, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) near [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north back to Flagstaff to finish the first loop.

The second loop (155 miles) winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". The second loop also circumnavigates [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet), and [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet). After refueling in Flagstaff, the second loop begins by heading north to rejoin the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. Next, the course follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet) and passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet). From here, riders will descend on double track to [Babbit Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). 

The **2019** edition of Pinyons and Pines will start on **Saturday, May 18** at 6AM at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com).
