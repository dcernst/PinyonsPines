Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course is roughly 282 miles and consists of two distinct loops, the Southern Loop and the Northern Loop. The total elevation gain for the route is about 22,000 feet, split evenly between the two loops. For 2020, the Southern Loop is 135 miles and passes through [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet) prior to following a mixture of dirt roads and the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) back to Flagstaff.  The Northern Loop is 147 miles and circumnavigates several extinct volcanoes, including the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona. Each year, the Southern Loop will more or less stay the same while the Northern Loop will differ from year to year, typically alternating between a clockwise (odd years) and a counterclockwise (even years) orientation.
Most years the Northern Loop will overlap substantially with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html).  When riders transition between the two loops, Flagstaff will be neutral territory. This means that riders may visit their cars, hotel rooms, homes, loved ones, etc. However, riders must return to the route where they left it. The details still need to be fleshed out and I will provide more guidance as we get closer to the event.

Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules) prior to registering for the event. Feel free to ask questions on the event's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PinyonsAndPines/) (or post in the forum on [bikepacking.net](http://bikepacking.net)).  Check out the [event recap](https://bikepacking.com/news/2019-pinyons-pines-event-recap/) from last year's race over on [Bikepacking.com](http://bikepacking.com).  Hopefully the weather will cooperate in 2020!

<strong>Important!</strong> This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time in comparison to others. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

The event will utilize [Trackleaders](http://trackleaders.com), providing a live map, elevation profile and other stats that can be used to follow along. Carrying a personal tracker (e.g., [SPOT](https://www.findmespot.com/en/), [Garmin InReach](https://explore.garmin.com/en-US/inreach/)) and being tracked by trackleaders is not mandatory but encouraged. Owners of personal trackers can expect to pay $15 to add their own device to Trackleaders. SPOT rentals (approximately $60 for a SPOT Gen3 with 5min tracking service and SOS) will also be available. Tracking signup link will be available about a month before race start.

The route for the Southern Loop is more or less finalized, but the Northern Loop is a work in progress.  You can see a draft of the proposed route below.
