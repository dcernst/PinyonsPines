Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking event that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course changes each year, but is typically around 300 miles. New for 2023, there will be a 300+ mile course and a 500+ course to choose from. The 2023 edition of Pinyons and Pines will start at 6:00AM on **Thursday, May 18**. The ride organizers are [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) and [Dylan Turner](https://www.instagram.com/theseasonedbikepacker/). Please [contact us](mailto:pinyonsandpines@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

Flagstaff sits at the base of the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top".  This year's course traverses the ancestral homelands of the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi), [Ndee/Nnēē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people) (Western Apache), [Yavapai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai), [A:shiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people) (Zuni Pueblo), and [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.

Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules) prior to registering for the event. Feel free to ask questions on the event's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PinyonsAndPines/).

<strong>Important!</strong> This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

The original 2019 patch was designed by [Shannon Villegas](https://www.instagram.com/macerdoodles/?hl=en). The design for the 2020 patch was a modification of the patch from our first year and was put together by [Chris Cone](https://www.instagram.com/conermania/). The 2021 patch was created from original artwork by Hopi artist and local mountain biker [Duane Koyawena](https://www.dkoyawenaarts.com). Here is what Duane has to say about the design:

> Within this work are images representative of our values as Hopi. We look to the sun, Tawa, in reverence as a guiding force and source of strength within our lives. Centered, Nuvatukyaovi, the place of snow, conveys the importance of this sacred place within our spiritual and cultural beliefs. The color red is symbolic of our land, Tuutskwa, the white dashes relate the importance of moisture, and the colors blue and yellow represent male and female.

The design for the 2022 patch is a riff on Duane's artwork by [Chris Cone](https://www.instagram.com/conermania/). The patch for 2023 will be designed by [Wyatt Spalding](https://www.instagram.com/wyattspalding/?hl=en).
