Flagstaff sits at the base of the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top".  This year's course traverses the ancestral homelands of the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi), [Ndee/Nnēē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people) (Western Apache), [Yavapai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai), [A:shiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people) (Zuni Pueblo), and [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.

Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules) prior to registering for the event. Feel free to ask questions on the event's [Strava group](https://www.strava.com/clubs/1382713) or reach out to us on [Instragram](https://www.instagram.com/pinyonspinesbikepackingrace/) or [email us](mailto:pinyonsandpines@gmail.com).

<strong>Important!</strong> This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time. A start time and route are provided and it is up to the participant to understand the route. Riders have full responsibility for their navigation and well being. The goal is to finish the entire route while setting your own pace.

<strong>Comments about registration:</strong>

- We will open registration sometime **8AM (AZ time) Thursday, April 15**.
- Registration will take place via [Trackleaders](http://trackleaders.com), much like AZTR and CTR.  Even folks that do not intend to be tracked by Trackleaders during the event will still use Trackleaders to register (for free if not paying for tracking).
- As usual, the cap will be 74 riders.
- Trackleaders will manage the waitlist.
- Reality: The past few editions have taught us that if you are serious about doing P&P and can commit to being in Flagstaff on May 15, then you are almost certain to get in. Don't panic if you don't get in on the day that registration opens. 
- ITTs are welcome at any time other than the Grand Depart.
- We make no promises about weather...

Thanks to our sponsors that help make this event possible!

The original 2019 patch was designed by [Shannon Villegas](https://www.instagram.com/macerdoodles/?hl=en). The design for the 2020 patch was a modification of the patch from our first year and was put together by [Chris Cone](https://www.instagram.com/conermania/). The 2021 patch was created from original artwork by Hopi artist and local mountain biker [Duane Koyawena](https://www.dkoyawenaarts.com). Here is what Duane has to say about the design:

> Within this work are images representative of our values as Hopi. We look to the sun, Tawa, in reverence as a guiding force and source of strength within our lives. Centered, Nuvatukyaovi, the place of snow, conveys the importance of this sacred place within our spiritual and cultural beliefs. The color red is symbolic of our land, Tuutskwa, the white dashes relate the importance of moisture, and the colors blue and yellow represent male and female.

The design for the 2022 and 2025 patches are a riff on Duane's artwork by [Chris Cone](https://www.instagram.com/conermania/). The patch for 2023 was designed by [Wyatt Spalding](https://www.instagram.com/wyattspalding/?hl=en).
