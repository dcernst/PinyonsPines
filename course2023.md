## 2023 Course Information

Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking event that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course changes each year, but is typically around 300 miles. New for 2023, there will be a 300+ mile course and a 500+ course to choose from. The 2023 edition of Pinyons and Pines will start at 6:00AM on **Thursday, May 18**. The ride organizers are [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) and [Dylan Turner](https://www.instagram.com/theseasonedbikepacker/). Please [contact us](mailto:pinyonsandpines@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

Flagstaff sits at the base of the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top".  This year's course traverses the ancestral homelands of the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi), [Ndee/Nnēē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people) (Western Apache), [Yavapai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai), [A:shiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people) (Zuni Pueblo), and [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.

Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules) prior to registering for the event. Feel free to ask questions on the event's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PinyonsAndPines/).

Below are some important notes, including information concerning resupply options for food and water. All mileages are approximate.

- Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules/).
- The start and finish is at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution.  If no one is at the finish to greet you, put your finish time on the sign in sheet that will be in the mailbox to the right of the door.
- Neutral roll out for the first 4.5 miles.  Folks can start riding at their own pace after the group crosses Mountain Dell Road.  
- The short and long routes overlap for the first 97 miles.
- **Important:** It's a long way from the start to the first reliable water.  Moreover, it's likely to be hot after dropping down off the rim into Sedona/Cottonwood.  Be sure to start with enough water!
- **Mile 37-41:** Be careful descending Casner Mountain Trail! This is the most serious part of the route. Its harder getting to this point than you'd expect.
- **Mile 65.5:** Verde Valley Bicycle Company is right on route. Several restaraunts nearby.
- **Mile 66.5:** 24 hour Maverick. Prepare for the long climb ahead!
- **Mile 77.5:** Copper Chief Spring is a piped spring on the right. No guarantees that this spring is still flowing. Water needs to be filtered/treated.
- **Mile 79:** Allen Spring flows out of a large pipe on the downhill side of the road. Easy to miss if you aren't listening for the water flowing.  No guarantees that this spring is still flowing, but it usually is during May. Water needs to be filtered/treated.

- **Mile 131.5:** There is a water spigot at the Beaver Creek Work Station. It's not clear whether this spigot is open to the public, but I've used it in the past.  
- **Miles 156-175:** Enjoy the smooth pavement of Lake Mary Road.  Good shoulder the whole way.
- **Mile 173:** Happy Jack Lodge.  Restaraunt and store.

- **Mile 211:** Water in Clear Creek at bottom of Barbershop Canyon. Water needs to be filtered/treated. Climb up out of Barbershop Canyon.
- **Mile 217.5:** Instead of crossing over HWY 87, turn left and ride a short distance to ranger station. There is a water spigot behind the first building on the right.
- **Miles 219-263:** Follow Arizona Trail. This stretch often takes longer than you'd expect.
- **Mile 255:** If necessary, detour to town of Mormon Lake if you are in need of food, etc.
- **Mile 258.5:** Double Spring Campground water spigot (and likely small creek). Water spigot should be on.
- **Mile 260:** Dairy Springs Campground. To access campground, turn right on Mormon Mountain Trail and descent to campground. Water spigot should be on.
- **Mile 267.5:** Weimer Spring. Spring is on left side of road.  Walk a short way up hill to access spring.

- **Mile 282.5:** Lake Mary Country Store.
- **Mile 283:** Easy access to Lower Lake Mary. Water needs to be filtered/treated.
- **Mile 285.5:** Detour to Upper Lake Mary. Instead of turning up towards Marshall Lake, continue on Lake Mary Road until you see the lake. Scramble down near fenced parking area.
- **Miles 288-327:** Almost all single track! The climb up Heart Trail and mile 314 is the last crux.
- **Mile 311:** Just south of tunnel that goes under Route 89, head southwest on double track to access Conoco Travel Center (open 24 hours).
