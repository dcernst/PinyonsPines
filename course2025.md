## 2025 Course Information

Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking event that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course changes each year! The 2025 edition of Pinyons and Pines will start at 6:00AM on **Thursday, May 15** and is approximately 340 miles in length with 30,000 feet of climbing. The ride organizers are [Dana Ernst](http://danaernst.com) and [Dylan Turner](https://www.youtube.com/@TheEnduranceStudio). Please [contact us](mailto:pinyonsandpines@gmail.com) with any questions or concerns.

Flagstaff sits at the base of the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), on homelands sacred to Native Americans throughout the region.  The Peaks, which includes [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona, have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top".  This year's course traverses the ancestral homelands of the [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi), [Ndee/Nnēē](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Apache_people) (Western Apache), [Yavapai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavapai), [A:shiwi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuni_people) (Zuni Pueblo), and [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo). We honor their past, present, and future generations, who have lived here for millennia and will forever call this place home.

Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). Please consult the [rules]({{ site.baseurl }}/rules) prior to registering for the event. Feel free to ask questions on the event's [Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/PinyonsAndPines/).

<strong>Important!</strong> This is an unsanctioned event. There are no fees, no prizes, but all attempts will be made to record your finish time.
