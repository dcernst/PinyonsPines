## 2020 Course Description

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<strong>Important!</strong> The following description is a draft and will be finalized at least a month prior to the event.
</div>

The course for 2020 is roughly 300 miles and consists of a Southern Portion (147 miles) and the Northern Portion (155 miles). The total elevation gain for the route is about 24,000 feet, split evenly between the two portions. The start and finish is at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), located at 3 South Mikes Pike, sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). Each year, the Southern Portion will more or less stay the same while the Northern Portion will differ from year to year, typically alternating between a clockwise and a counterclockwise orientation.

The Southern Portion (147 miles) begins with a neutral rollout as the route heads south and navigates through the campus of Northern Arizona University. After about 1.5 miles, the route hangs a right on a portion of the Flagstaff Urban Trail (FUTS). The race is on after the group crosses Mt. Dell Road, roughly mile 3.3. Riders will turn right about a mile later and follow singletrack for several miles before reaching Woody Mountain Road. The route then heads south following mostly dirt roads and eventually descends [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Be careful descending Casner Mountain! More dirt roads eventually deposit riders onto some of Sedona's best singletrack as the route navigates towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. Riders should be sure to refuel and stock up on food and water before ascending Schnebly Hill Road. After crossing under Interstate 17, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) above [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north via mostly singletrack for a few miles before turning onto dirt roads, which riders will follow until reaching Lake Mary Road. After a couple miles of pavement, the route climbs up to Marshall Lake to rejoin the AZT, which riders will follow (choosing the equestrian bypass option at roughly mile 131.5) until Campbell Mesa. The route follows a few miles of single track through Campbell Mesa and then rejoins the AZT. The Southern Portion officially ends where the route crosses under Route 89. A 24-hour resupply option is a short distance to the southwest just before the tunnel.

The Northern Portion (155 miles) winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". After refueling at the Conoco on 89A, the Northern Portion begins by heading north on the AZT towards Schultz Pass.  The Northern Portion is currently a work in progress, but you can see a draft of the proposed route below.


<!-- Due to logging closures, the route will follow Chimney and then Lower Moto Trail before rejoining the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. After descending singletrack through an aspen grove, the course merges with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html) and follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet), and eventually descends on double track to [Babbitt Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). As the route turns south, riders will cross over a lava flow and pedal by [SP Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_P_Crater), the first of several cinder cone volcanoes. The route then turns east around [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet) and onto loose cinder trails that link into the back entrance of [Sunset Crater National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Crater). Riders then follow pavement through the National Monument along recent lava flows before climbing a steep dirt road into Lockett Meadow and the "inner basin" of the San Francisco Peaks. From here, riders will climb to Waterline Road via beautiful but technical singletrack to the highest part of the route. While descending Waterline Road, riders will pass through remnants of the [Schultz Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schultz_Fire) while enjoying huge views along the west side of the Peaks. In order to bypass the logging closure, near the bottom of Waterline Road, the route turns left onto the pipeline and descends for a couple of miles to Deer Hill Trail. Riders will turn right on Deer Hill Trail, pass through Little Elden Springs Horse Camp, cross Elden Springs Road, and then turn south on the equestrian bypass of the AZT.  There are often horses in this area and riders should follow appropriate trail etiquette. The route contours around the east side of [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet), and eventually passes along the rim of Walnut Canyon. The final few miles of the second loop are the same as the first loop. The route finishes at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution. -->

Below are some important notes, including information concerning resupply options for food and water.

### Southern Portion

- **Important:** It's a long way from the start to the first reliable water.  Moreover, it's likely to be hot after dropping down off the rim into Sedona.  Be sure to start with enough water!
- **Mile 37:** Be careful descending Casner Mountain Trail! This is the most serious part of the route.
- **Miles 42-52:** This portion of the route is different than last year.  We will follow a part of the [Robbers Roost Bikepacking Route](https://bikepacking.com/routes/robbers-roost-overnighter/) (in the opposite direction). This variation will be more scenic and will hopefully reduce the interaction with Jeeps and Razors.
- **Mile 47.5:** There is a bathroom at the Honanki Heritage Site, but no water.
- **Mile 53.8:** Turn right into a what looks like a dirt parking lot and then follow a faint trail to the Aerie Trailhead.
- **Mile 60:** Shortly after crossing a paved road, there is an intermittent stream that may have water in it. Water needs to be filtered or treated.
- **Mile 62.4:** Turn left off of Dry Creek Road onto the Chimney Rock Connector Trail.  You will need to hop a white fence to continue on the route.  If you'd prefer not to lift your bike over the fence, you can continue south on Dry Creek Road and navigate your way through the neighborhood and eventually regain the route at the Thunder Mountain Trailhead.
- **Mile 68.6:** Pass through a tunnel, which goes under Route 89A.
- **Mile 68.9:** Shortly after merging onto Route 89A, you'll have a few options for stocking up on food and water before leaving Sedona. There is a 76 gas station on the right side of Route 89A at the second round about that has a modest supply of snacks. After turning south on Route 179, Arroyo Roble Marketplace is on the right side of the road. There is a Circle K on Route 179 about a quarter of a mile past the turn onto Schnebly Hill Road. If you want to grab a meal, there is a Burger King on the right side of 89A just before the second round about and Oregano's is a short distance south on Route 179. Both of these are on route. In addition, Starbucks, Chipotle, and Wildflower Bread Company are in a shopping plaza on a hill on 89A a bit north of the intersection with Route 179. There are also a few bike shops in Sedona.  [Over the Edge](https://otesports.com/locations/sedona/) and the [Fat Tire Bike Shop](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Fat-Tire-Bike-Shop/188731981168703) are the closest shops to the route.
- **Mile 81.3:** There is a water spigot at the ADOT yard just before crossing under Interstate 17. The spigot is located near a ramada in a grassy area by some houses. If for some reason this spigot is turned off, you might consider riding north on the interstate to the town of Munds Park, where you'll have access to food and water.
- **Mile 94.9:** You'll be riding fast on a dirt road and the lefthand turn onto the Arizona Trail is easy to miss. In the event of an emergency, continue straight on FS240 and then turn right at the bottom of the hill towards Mormon Lake Lodge.
- **Mile 103.5:** Weimer Spring is just south of the road.  You'll need to filter/treat the water. If you are thinking of splitting the Southern Portion into two days, this would make a nice place to camp.
- **Mile 117.8:** The route turns right onto Lake Mary Road. The [Lake Mary Country Store](http://www.lakemarycountrystore.com) (7am-6pm, 5pm on Sunday) is to the left on Lake Mary Road.
- **Miles 118-147:** This portion of the route is different than last year. It adds some miles, but it's much more enjoyable.
- **Mile 147:** Just south of tunnel that goes under Route 89, head southwest on double track to access Conoco Travel Center (open 24 hours).

### Northern Portion

- **Mile 147:** After refueling at the Conoco Travel Center, return to the route, pass under Route 89, and follow the AZT towards Shultz Pass.
- **Mile 154.2:** When you hit Schultz Pass Road, turn right. If you are just staring at the track on your GPS device, you could get confused because you will be back at this exact spot in roughly 140 miles.
- **Miles 155.4-163.3:** There may be downed trees on Waterline Road. Most of them are easy to lift your bike over, but some of them could be a bit annoying.
- **Mile 163.3:** Turn off of Waterline Road onto the Inner Basin Trail. This is one of my favorite sections of trail in Arizona, but it is also popular with hikers, which you should yield to no matter how much of a hurry you are in.
- **Mile 165.3:** There is a small pond on the left just before turning left onto Lockett Meadow Road. Water needs to be filtered or treated.
- **Mile 171.9:** Depending on when you enter Sunset Crater National Monument, you may be stopped at the entrance booth. If you have a Parks Pass, bring it with you just in case. Just after passing the entrance booth, there is a Visitor's Center on the right. There is drinking fountain outside that you can use to refill water.  There is also a vending machine, but does not always work (and the staff in the Visitor's Center does not always have the means to break change or help with the machine). There is also a bathroom that is sometimes open after hours, but do not assume it will be open. It's a long way to the next water source!
- **Mile 212.7:** Where the AZT merges in from the left (we are not going that way), there is a public cache box hidden in the bushes. Do not take any water (or food) that is designated for an individual! The race organizer (Dana Ernst) will stock this cache before and after the race.
- More coming soon!

<!-- - **Mile 129.7:** Just north of the turn on Schultz Pass Road, there is a Shell gas station on the right side of Highway 180.
- **Mile 141.2:** Alfa Fia Tank is a short distance to the west. You'll need to filter/treat the water.
- **Mile 173.3:** Tiptop Tank is a fairly consistent stock tank on the left side of the road. You'll definitely need to filter/treat the water.

- **Mile 250.5:** The GPX track entering the horse camp after descending the pipeline after Waterline Road is stupid for about a quarter mile. Not It’s best to just stay on Deer Hill Trail into parking lot of horse camp. This needs to be fixed.
- **Mile 251:** About a mile of the AZT has been rerouted and disagrees withe GPX track. Moral of the story, just follow the trail. This needs to be fixed.
- **Mile 255.1:** Shortly after passing through a tunnel under Route 89, you can access the Conoco Travel Center (open 24 hours) by turning right on double track. This is a very short distance off route. -->

The route for the Southern Portion is more or less finalized, but the Northern Portion is a work in progress.  You can see a draft of the proposed route below.
