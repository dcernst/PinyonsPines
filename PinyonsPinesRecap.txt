Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking race that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops. The first loop is 125 miles and passes through [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet) prior to following a mixture of dirt roads and the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) back to Flagstaff.  The second loop is 155 miles and circumnavigates several extinct volcanoes, including the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona. The second loop overlaps substantially with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html). The total elevation gain for the route is about 21,000 feet. Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). The stunning scenery should make Pinyons and Pines appealing to experts and beginners alike.

While a pinyon (or piñon) is a type of pine, the name of the race is inspired by the two predominant vegetation zones that the race passes through, namely pinyon-juniper woodland (pinyons) and ponderosa pine forest (pines).  Flagstaff is home to the largest ponderosa pine forest on the planet and over half of the race is spent pedaling among the majestic ponderosas.  The southern portion of the first loop and the northeastern part of the second loop drop down into elevations favoring pinyons and junipers.

The first loop begins with a neutral rollout as the route heads south and navigates through the campus of [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu). After following a portion of the Flagstaff Urban Trail (FUTS), the race is on after the group crosses Mt. Dell Road, roughly mile 3.3. A few miles of fantastic singletrack take riders up and over the shoulder of Woody Mountain and then the route heads south following mostly dirt roads. Eventually, riders carefully descend the [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Riders get to sample some of Sedona's sweet singletrack as they navigate towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. Sedona provides plenty of options for refueling on food and water. Riders should be sure to refuel and stock up on food and water before ascending Schnebly Hill Road. After crossing under Interstate 17, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) near [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north via mostly singletrack for a few miles before turning onto dirt roads, which riders will follow until reaching Lake Mary Road. After a mile of pavement, the route turns back onto singletrack that leads to the AZT and back to Flagstaff.

The second loop winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". After refueling in Flagstaff, the second loop begins by heading north on the FUTS towards Schultz Pass Road.  Due to logging closures, this year's followed a short detour before rejoining the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. After descending singletrack through an aspen grove, the course merges with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html) and follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet), and eventually descends on double track to [Babbitt Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). As the route turns south, riders will cross over a lava flow and pedal by [SP Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_P_Crater), the first of several cinder cone volcanoes. The route then turns east around [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet) and onto a loose cinder road that links into the back entrance of [Sunset Crater National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Crater). Riders then follow pavement through the National Monument along recent lava flows before climbing a steep dirt road into Lockett Meadow and the "inner basin" of the San Francisco Peaks. From here, riders climb to Waterline Road via beautiful but technical singletrack to the highest part of the route. While descending Waterline Road, riders pass through remnants of the [Schultz Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schultz_Fire) while enjoying huge views along the west side of the Peaks. Near the bottom of Waterline Road, this year's route detours around a logging closure before turning south on the equestrian bypass of the AZT. The route contours around the east side of [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet), and eventually passes along the rim of Walnut Canyon. The final few miles of the second loop are the same as the first loop. The route finishes at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution.

The inaugural edition of Pinyons and Pines, started at 6AM on Saturday, May 18, 2019. Despite the weather forecast calling for snow, rain, and strong winds for the second day of the race, 39 people were at the start. Four pairs were racing in the duo category and the rest were racing solo. In attempt to get ahead of the weather, two individuals and one duo started ITTs at various times the day before.


Top of Casner: Ty Hopkins, Cone, Micah Clinger, Dana, Mack Gerrit, Lucas Ratliff. Ben Hanus not too far behind.
Sedona: Ty and Cone, followed by Dana, Micah, Lucas.

Flagstaff: Cone, followed a few minutes later by Dana and Ty. After a quick resupply and some yummy pasties from the Cornish Pasty Company, Cone and Ernst set off on the second loop around 7:30pm. After reviewing the weather forecast, Hopkins decided to throw in the towel before starting the second loop.

Then Micah and Lucas. Gerrit, followed by Harris. Hanus took a wrong turn and followed end of second loop in reverse. He climbed a couple hundred feet and rode several miles before recognizing his mistake. Hanus, Seistrup, Artec Durham, and Andy Havey all arrived in Flagstaff within 20 minutes of each other, roughly 4 hours behind the leaders.  Of these, only Hanus, Seistrup, and Durham started off on the second loop. Billy McMillen was the only other rider to make it back to Flagstaff in less than 24 hours, but he did not start the second loop.  The remaining riders either slept a few hours or scratched before making it back to Flagstaff.

Two duos and 23 solo riders successfully completed the first loop.  In addition, Ceasar Medina and the duo consisting of Jeff Hemperley and Holly Hovious completed the first loop, having started their ITTs the night before the grand depart.  Despite the threat of severe weather, 14 riders were inspired to start the second loop.



Hanus, Seistrup, and Durham started the second loop just before midnight. Meanwhile, Cone and Ernst detoured to the Flagstaff Nordic Center to refill on water and catch an hour of sleep. Around this time, the temperature started to drop and the wind was getting angry. Shortly after leaving Flagstaff, Seistrup stopped to sleep trailside for a couple hours while Hanus and Durham pressed on. At around 4am, Durham stopped to sleep and escape the wind in the Chapel of the Holy Dove, which is a short distance off route.  Here is what Durham posted on Facebook a couple of hours later: "I'm bailing, the wind is insane and real cold. Made it to hy180 at 4am and took shelter, was so cold. Woke up to gusting winds, and they seem to be getting stronger. Going to get a ride back to flag. I'll give it another go next year. Thanks Dana Ernst."

Cone and Ernst made it to the AZT cache box on Babbitt Ranch (mile 190) just as the sun was rising. Around this time, Hanus was south of Kendrick Peak (roughly mile 155) and Seistrup was traversing the AZT west of the San Francisco Peaks (roughly mile 140). Hanus and Seistrup would reach the AZT cache box roughly 3.75 and 6 hours later, respectively.

Around 9am, most of the racers that decided to tackle the second loop were getting started. Around this time, Cone and Ernst were slogging their way up the cinder road east of O'Leary Peak.  The wind was battering Cone and Ernst while Hanus and Seistrup were treated to the world's best tailwind. At mile 227, Cone and Ernst turned onto pavement near Sunset Crater.  The headwind was so intense at this point that Cone and Ernst had to stand and pedal in their easiest gear while riding downhill.  Both riders were blown off the road multiple times. Cone and Ernst arrived at the Sunset Crater Visitor's Center (mile 231) at 9:45am. Both riders took shelter from the wind for almost an hour and contemplated their fate. The wind was continuing to howl and it was snowing and raining on the Peaks, which is where the route headed next. Both riders had legitimate concerns about the wind, weather, and falling trees. Ernst was also having a hard time pedaling due to increasing knee pain that was a result of the crash from the previous night. Ultimately, Cone decided to scratch and Ernst chose to press on.
