Pinyons and Pines is an underground self-supported bikepacking route that starts and ends in [Flagstaff, AZ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flagstaff,_Arizona) (6,910 feet). The route is a magnificent tour of Northern Arizona, utilizing a mixture of singletrack, double track, and dirt roads.  The start and finish are at [Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution](http://flagbikerev.com), sandwiched between [Pizzicletta](http://www.pizzicletta.com) and [Mother Road Brewery](https://www.motherroadbeer.com). The course is roughly 280 miles and consists of two distinct loops. The first loop is 125 miles and passes through [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet) prior to following a mixture of dirt roads and the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) back to Flagstaff.  The second loop is 155 miles and circumnavigates several extinct volcanoes, including the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona. The second loop overlaps substantially with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html). The total elevation gain for the route is about 21,000 feet. Riders can choose between two categories: solo or duo (2-person team). The stunning scenery should make Pinyons and Pines appealing to experts and beginners alike.

While a pinyon (or piñon) is a type of pine, the name of the route is inspired by the two predominant vegetation zones that the route passes through, namely pinyon-juniper woodland (pinyons) and ponderosa pine forest (pines).  Flagstaff is home to the largest ponderosa pine forest on the planet and over half of the route is spent pedaling among the majestic ponderosas.  The southern portion of the first loop and the northeastern part of the second loop drop down into elevations favoring pinyons and junipers.

The first loop begins with a neutral rollout as the route heads south and navigates through the campus of [Northern Arizona University](http://nau.edu). After following a portion of the Flagstaff Urban Trail (FUTS), folks can start riding at their own pace after the group crosses Mt. Dell Road, roughly mile 3.3. A few miles of fantastic singletrack take riders up and over the shoulder of Woody Mountain and then the route heads south following mostly dirt roads. Eventually, riders carefully descend the [Casner Mountain Trail](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55262) to the red rock of [Sedona](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedona,_Arizona) (4,350 feet). Riders get to sample some of Sedona's sweet singletrack as they navigate towards the bottom of Schnebly Hill Road. Sedona provides plenty of options for refueling on food and water. Riders should be sure to refuel and stock up on food and water before ascending Schnebly Hill Road. After crossing under Interstate 17, the route weaves its way east via a network of Forest Service roads to meet up with the [Arizona Trail](https://aztrail.org) near [Mormon Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormon_Lake), Arizona's largest natural lake. The route then follows the AZT north via mostly singletrack for a few miles before turning onto dirt roads, which riders will follow until reaching Lake Mary Road. After a mile of pavement, the route turns back onto singletrack that leads to the AZT and back to Flagstaff.

The second loop winds its way through Ponderosa pine forests and grasslands among hundreds of extinct volcanoes. The centerpiece of the second loop is the [San Francisco Peaks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_Peaks), home to [Humphreys Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humphreys_Peak) (12,633 feet), the highest point in Arizona.  The Peaks have religious significance to several Native American tribes. In particular, the Peaks form the [Diné](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navajo) (Navajo) sacred mountain of the west, called Dook'o'oosłííd, which means "the summit that never melts". The [Hopi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopi) name for the Peaks is Nuva'tukya'ovi, which translates to "place-of-snow-on-the-very-top". After refueling in Flagstaff, the second loop begins by heading north on the FUTS towards Schultz Pass Road.  Due to logging closures, this year's followed a short detour before rejoining the AZT.  While contouring the southern and western flanks of the Peaks, riders will be treated to roughly 20 miles of the best singletrack the AZT has to offer. After descending singletrack through an aspen grove, the course merges with the popular [Craters and Cinder Cones Loop](https://www.bikepackingroots.org/craters-and-cinder-cones.html) and follows spectacular dirt roads around the west side of [Kendrick Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendrick_Peak) (10,425 feet), passes by [Slate Mountain](https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/coconino/recarea/?recid=55180) (8,215 feet), and eventually descends on double track to [Babbitt Ranch](http://www.babbittranches.com). As the route turns south, riders will cross over a lava flow and pedal by [SP Crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_P_Crater), the first of several cinder cone volcanoes. The route then turns east around [O'Leary Peak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O%27Leary_Peak) (8,919 feet) and onto a loose cinder road that links into the back entrance of [Sunset Crater National Monument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Crater). Riders then follow pavement through the National Monument along recent lava flows before climbing a steep dirt road into Lockett Meadow and the "inner basin" of the San Francisco Peaks. From here, riders climb to Waterline Road via beautiful but technical singletrack to the highest part of the route. While descending Waterline Road, riders pass through remnants of the [Schultz Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schultz_Fire) while enjoying huge views along the west side of the Peaks. Near the bottom of Waterline Road, this year's route detours around a logging closure before turning south on the equestrian bypass of the AZT. The route contours around the east side of [Mount Elden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Elden) (9,301 feet), and eventually passes along the rim of Walnut Canyon. The final few miles of the second loop are the same as the first loop. The route finishes at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution.

The inaugural edition of Pinyons and Pines, started at 6AM on Saturday, May 18, 2019. Despite the weather forecast calling for snow, rain, and strong winds for the second day of the ride, 39 people were at the start. Four pairs were racing in the duo category and the rest were racing solo. In attempt to get ahead of the weather, two individuals and one duo started ITTs at various times the day before. Every rider received a free event patch, a coupon for a free pizza at Pizzicletta, and a sample of [Squirrel's Nut Butter Saddle Butter](https://squirrelsnutbutter.com/collections/cycling). Folks started gathering at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution about an hour before go time.  The shop was gracious enough to provide coffee and donuts for riders.  After riders had a chance to mingle, I made a few quick announcements and then we were off.

The group stayed together during the neutral roll out, but then several riders, including myself, upped the pace as we entered the first section of singletrack.  A small group consisting of Ty Hopkins (author of [Just Ride: Racing 2,725 Miles to Mexico](https://www.amazon.com/Just-Ride-Racing-Miles-Mexico/dp/1796843180)), Chris Cone, Micah Clinger, Lucas Ratliff, Mack Gerrit (riding single speed), and myself were the first to reach Sedona (mile 67) after roughly 7 hours.  All of us stopped at Burger King to refuel.  At this point, Ben Hanus was about 30 minutes back and Chris Seistrup (winner of the 2019 Tour Divide) was 2 hours behind. Hanus and Seistrup would go on to place first and second.

Cone was the first to make it back to Flagstaff (mile 126) and finish the first loop in 12 hours and 53 minutes, followed a few minutes later by me and Hopkins.  After a quick resupply and some yummy pasties from the Cornish Pasty Company, me and Cone set off on the second loop around 7:30pm. After reviewing the weather forecast, Hopkins decided to throw in the towel before starting the second loop.  About an hour later, Clinger and Lucas finished the first loop, followed by Mack and then Dave Harris another hour later.  Hanus took a wrong turn and followed the end of second loop in reverse. He climbed a couple hundred feet and rode several miles before recognizing his mistake. Hanus, Seistrup, Artec Durham, and Andy Havey (riding single speed) all arrived in Flagstaff within 20 minutes of each other, roughly 4 hours behind the leaders.  Of these, only Hanus, Seistrup, and Durham started off on the second loop. Billy McMillen was the only other rider to make it back to Flagstaff in less than 24 hours, but he did not start the second loop.  The remaining riders either slept a few hours or scratched before making it back to Flagstaff.

Two duos and 23 solo riders successfully completed the first loop.  In addition, Ceasar Medina and the duo consisting of Jeff Hemperley and Holly Hovious completed the first loop, having started their ITTs the night before the grand depart.  Despite the threat of severe weather, a total of 14 riders were inspired to start the second loop.

Hanus, Seistrup, and Durham started the second loop just before midnight. Meanwhile, Cone and I had detoured to the Flagstaff Nordic Center to refill on water and catch an hour of sleep. Around this time, the temperature started to drop and the wind was getting angry. Shortly after leaving Flagstaff, Seistrup stopped to sleep trailside for a couple hours while Hanus and Durham pressed on. At around 4am, Durham stopped to sleep and escape the wind in the Chapel of the Holy Dove, which is a short distance off route.  Here is what Durham posted on Facebook a couple of hours later: "I'm bailing, the wind is insane and real cold. Made it to hy180 at 4am and took shelter, was so cold. Woke up to gusting winds, and they seem to be getting stronger. Going to get a ride back to flag. I'll give it another go next year. Thanks Dana Ernst."

Cone and I made it to the AZT cache box on Babbitt Ranch (mile 190) just as the sun was rising. Sometime during the night, I had a silly crash while riding uphill and smashed my knee into my handlebars. I didn't think much of it at the time, but by morning, I was having quite a bit of pain while pedaling. While Cone and I were eating breakfast at the AZT cache box, Hanus was south of Kendrick Peak (roughly mile 155) and Seistrup was traversing the AZT west of the San Francisco Peaks (roughly mile 140). Hanus and Seistrup would reach the AZT cache box roughly 3.75 and 6 hours later, respectively.

Around 9am on day two, most of the riders that decided to tackle the second loop were getting started. At this time, Cone and I were slogging our way up the cinder road east of O'Leary Peak.  The wind was battering us while Hanus and Seistrup were occasionally treated to the world's best tailwind. At mile 227, Cone and I turned onto pavement near Sunset Crater.  The headwind was so intense at this point that we had to stand and pedal in our easiest gear while riding downhill.  Both of us were blown off the road multiple times. I've never experienced anything like that before. We arrived at the Sunset Crater Visitor's Center (mile 231) at 10am. We took shelter from the wind for almost an hour and contemplated our fate. The wind was continuing to howl and it was snowing and raining on the Peaks, which is where the route headed next. We had legitimate concerns about the wind, weather, and falling trees along Waterline Road, which was burned in the massive Schultz Fire in 2010. I was also having serious doubts about my knee being able to make it the rest of the way. Ultimately, Cone decided to scratch while I reluctantly chose to press on.

The time off the bike made my knee worse, but I hoped that it would improve after I got rolling again.  The climb up to Lockett Meadow was absolutely brutal in the wind.  I had to get off and walk several times because the wind was so strong. By the time I made it to the meadow around 12:30pm, it was alternating between rain and snow. Meanwhile, those that had started the second loop that morning were on the other side of the Peaks and getting dumped on by snow. Around this time, Hanus was riding the cinder road on the east side of O'Leary Peak while Seistrup was getting hammered with a cross wind near SP Crater.  Typically I would (barely) ride up the Inner Basin Trail to Waterline Road, but the pain in my knee was significant enough that I walked nearly the whole thing.  I was somewhat sheltered from the wind, but the trees were swaying back and forth while creaking.  The numerous downed trees across the trail were not encouraging.  When I finally reached Waterline Road, I was greeted to driving rain. Part of me was looking forward to the long descent down Waterline Road so that I could rest my knee, but I was also concerned about the wind.  Unfortunately, the cold rain coupled with a ridiculous number of downed trees didn't give me the reprieve that I was hoping for.  Moreover, the wind was downright terrifying and I had to be careful not to get blown off the side of the mountain.

After what seemed like an eternity, I eventually turned onto the AZT around 2:30pm. Intense sharp pain in my knee prevented me from riding anything I couldn't coast down. As I pushed my bike for most of the next few miles, I wrestled with the idea of dropping out. I couldn't tell if my knee was just sore from my crash or if I was doing serious damage.  All I knew was that I couldn't pedal anymore. Even though I only had 18 more miles to go, when I reached route 89 at 3:30pm, I called my wife and asked her to pick me up.  I had ridden 262 miles in 33.5 hours.

At the time I dropped out, Hanus was only 3 hours behind me and Seistrup was about 6 hours back. With the exception of Lyndsey Shepard, the weather together with the realistic threat of many miles of peanut butter mud near Babbitt Ranch caused the rest of the field to turn around and head back to Flagstaff.  After making it all the way to mile 184, Shepard made the call to scratch.

Hanus and Seistrup continued to solider on, battling wind, rain, and snow.  Hanus rolled into the finish at Flagstaff Bicycle Revolution around 11:30pm with a finish time of 1 day, 17 hours, 20 minutes. Seistrup finished a few hours later with a time of 1 day, 20 hours, 10 minutes.  The 2019 Pinyons and Pines had a whopping two finishers.  The duo consisting of Hemperley and Hovious returned a couple weeks later to ride the second loop in more favorable conditions. The first loop also saw two ITTs from duos later in the summer.  Check out the [results page](http://danaernst.com/PinyonsPines/results/) for more details.  You can see how it all unfolded by watching the replay on [Trackleaders](http://trackleaders.com/pinyonspines19).

Despite the fact that the weather got the better of us, I think the first edition of Pinyons and Pines was a success.  I intend to make a few tweaks to the route for next year while keeping the spirit the same.  Not counting Liz Sampey who joined us for part of the first loop and never intended to ride the whole route, we only had one solo female rider (Lyndsey Shepard). This is clearly an area that needs improvement. I hope to see more women at the event next year.
