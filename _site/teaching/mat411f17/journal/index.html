<p>We’ll use this page to keep track of what has happened each day in class. It won’t contain any of the nitty-gritty details, but will instead serve to summarize what has transpired each day.</p>

<h2 id="week-1">Week 1</h2>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, August 28:</b> First day! I kicked off class by summarizing the first few homework assignments, which was followed by a whirlwind tour of the <a href="/teaching/mat411f17/">course webpage</a>.  After this, the students engaged in the first half of the <a href="/teaching/SettingTheStage.pdf">Setting the Stage</a> activity, which was followed by a short discussion of productive failure and productive struggle. The remaining portion of class was devoted to highlighting some key items on the syllabus.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, August 30:</b> The first few minutes of class were devoted to learning names and making sure there weren't any questions about the syllabus. We then split the class up into several small groups, where each group was responsible for one of problems from the homework.  After a few minutes we came back together to discuss the problems.  Our very first presentation was given by BW. She presented Exercise 2.2 and did a great job! With the time remaining we had AO, JC, and LC present Exercises 2.3, 2.5, and 2.9, respectively. Along the way, I discussed Exercise 2.4.  I'm really pleased with how things went today. Unfortunately, we didn't get to Exercises 2.6, 2.8, 2.10-2.14. The plan is tackle these problems during the next class.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 1:</b> Another busy but productive day.  I spent the first few minutes discussing few key points.  This discussion included a summary of the rules for the intuitive definition of a group.  The rest of class was devoted to covering ground in the notes.  Along the way, MG, JG, DW, and AB2 presented Exercises 2.8, 2.10, 2.11, and 2.17, respectively.  In addition, I lead discussions about Exercises 2.6, 2.12, 2.14, 2.18, and 2.19.  Exercises 2.20-2.23 are still outstanding.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-2">Week 2</h2>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 4:</b> Labor Day, no class!</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 6:</b> I really enjoyed today!  The first few minutes were devoted to discussing Exercises 2.20-2.23, which were left over from last week.  This discussion included a review of the Rules 1-4 for the intuitive definition of a group.  Next, we split the class up into 8 small groups, where each group was tasked with discussing one of Exercises 3.1, 3.2/3.3, 3.4, 3.5/3.6.  We had SS, RF, NF, and DF present 3.1, 3.2/3.3, 3.4, and 3.5/3.6, respectively. We will squeeze in a quick discussion of Exercise 3.7 on Friday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 8:</b> We cranked through a lot of stuff today. We kicked off with a general discussion of Cayley diagrams and then we chatted about Exercises 3.7 and 3.8. After small groups discussed problems, we had CK, GC, DV, and AO present Exercises 3.9(c), 3.10(cd), 3.11(bcd), and 3.11(fg), respectively. All the presentations were great.  With the 10 minutes we had remaining, we spent some time discussing LaTeX, which students will use to type up their first weekly homework assignment. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-3">Week 3</h2>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 12:</b> After a few quick announcements, we jumped right into student presentations.  JN, EM, BD, and AB2 presented Exercises 3.12, 3.13, 3.14, and 3.15, respectively.  All of the presentations generated good discussion.  Next, I summarized the key points of Exercises 3.16 and 3.17.  With the few minutes we had left, I discussed the use of LaTeX for the Weekly Homework.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 13:</b> Dr. Falk covered for me today while I was out.  My understanding is that DW, JG, TR, JC, GF, JN, and DV presented Exercise 4.2, Exercise 4.3, Exercise 4.5, Theorem 4.6, Exercise 4.7, Theorem 4.8, and Exercise 4.11, respectively.  The plan is to wrap up 4.12 and 4.13 next time.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Friday, September 15:</b> Dr. Falk covered for me again today. BD, LC, SS, and JR presented Exercises 4.12, 4.13, 4.14, and Exercise 4.15  Our goal on Monday will be to wrap up discussion of 4.16, 4.19-4.24 and tackle 4.25-4.28.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="week-4">Week 4</h2>

<ul class="fa-ul">
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, September 18:</b> Today was action packed.

As we marched through the notes, we had MG, JG, AO, and NF presented Exercise 4.19, Theorem 4.20, Problem 4.22, and Problem 4.25, respectively.  I also led discussion on Problem 4.21, Exercise 4.23, Problem 4.24, and Problem 4.26, respectively.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, September 20:</b> After a few announcements, we split the class up into 7 small groups, where each group was tasked with discussing one of the homework problems.

  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Monday, October 2:</b> While the students are working on the take-home portion of Exam 1, I will lecture over stuff in the notes.  Today, I discussed Problem 5.39, Problem 5.40, Problem 5.42, Problem 5.43, and Problem 5.45.  We'll pick up where we left off on Wednesday.</li>
  <li><i class="fa-li far fa-calendar-check"></i><b>Wednesday, October 4:</b> After handing back the in-class portion of Exam 1, we had a quick discussion of a few of the commonly missed problems.

After summarizing a few of the key theorems, we jumped in and tried to prove some stuff. We had BD, NF, AB1, DW, RF, and TR present Theorem 7.9(a), Theorem 7.10(reflexive), Theorem 7.10(symmetric), Theorem 7.10(transitive), Theorem 7.13(injective), and Theorem 7.13(surjective), respectively. Along the way, I proved Corollary 7.12 and Corollary 7.14.</li>
